		<p id="text"> <span class="highlight">H E X P E R I M E N T - a word play between the words "hex" and "experiment".</span> A word that encapsulates perfectly what this website is all about! A witchy themed "all-about Chemistry" website! Here, you'll find <span class="highlight">the history of Chemistry (A-Lore-Chemy)</span> and other stuff about it! (Coming soon...). This website has been created because I found Chemistry to be a fun subject, and it was something I've always associated with potions. Potions for me = Witches too! Enjoy navigating through the website and I hope this visit is a most insightful one indeed! Time to scurry off on my broom...whoooshhh...</p>
